                    We join forces with communities to create power to support

                    Rural communities that are out of grid connections owing to
                    their geographical locations do not need to worry going
                    forward. We partner with communities to help design,
                    implement and generate local power to sustain their
                    community and ease their communal life with flexible payment
                    plans.
