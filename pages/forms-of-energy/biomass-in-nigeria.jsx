                      Biomass energy, or "bioenergy," is energy from plants and
                      plant-derived materials. Emerging technologies exist that
                      help transform food crops, grassy and woody plants,
                      residues from agriculture organic components and
                      industrial waste to a range of valuable liquid biofuels,
                      chemicals similar to what is obtainable from oil
                      refineries and petrochemicals.
