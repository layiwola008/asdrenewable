                      One of the fastest-growing renewable energy technologies
                      is wind energy. Globally, wind energy installed capacity
                      increased from 74GW to 564GW in 2018 and it accounted for
                      16% of the energy generated by renewables.
                    </em>

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Electricity is generated by changing kinetic energy to
                  rotational energy which rotates a shaft connected to a
                  generator through electromagnetism.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The conversion from the air in motion to electrical energy is
                  done by a wind turbine, wind first hits a turbineâ€™s blades,
                  causing them to rotate and turn the turbine connected to them.
                  The turbine's size coupled with its blades' length determines
                  the total power that can be garnered from the wind.

                  <br />
                  Nigeria's energy gap will be greatly reduced and electricity
                  access increased by taking advantage of the huge opportunity
                  and energy potential offered.
