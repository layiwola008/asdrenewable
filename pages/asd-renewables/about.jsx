                    ASD emerged as a global energy solution and distribution
                    provider, tapping into the opportunity presented in
                    Nigeria's energy and power shortage to deliver sustainable
                    energy, storage and consumption, including energy
                    digitalization to power industrial, residential, farm and
                    remote areas of the country.

                reduce Nigeria's energy gap amid increasing energy growth and
                demand.
